The Scripts Folder
------------------

This folder is used to house *legacy* or *mission-specific* scripting files and items.

If you're creating a new script and you believe that you'll use it in more than one mission, reference the
framework documentation on how to create a new module first, as that's the most proper way to do it.

You may run these scripts via the "init.sqf" file in the root of the mission directory, and it provides ways
to run these scripts either before or after all of the modules have been initialized. Reference the file
"init.sqf" for [slightly] more information on implementing legacy scripts.
