Team Roster Module Readme
-------------------------

Important: All units which need to use the team roster system MUST be named in the editor!

## Notes

In order for the team roster system to load in single player, make sure to save the mission twice before
loading in so the system can load all of the new units. This only needs to be done when units are added,
edited, or deleted.
